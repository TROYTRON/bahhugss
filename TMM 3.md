# ARCOLOGIES - "HABS ON EARTH"

Arcologies are humanity's premier political and industrial centres of power. By the time BAHHSCQ takes place, the majority of humanity live in Arcologies, and all significant economic activity takes place there. So it will be important to properly simulate these in the scenario.

At the same time, human activity in the solar system will be very limited compared to TI: partly because of more pressing troubles on Earth, and partly because after the Antagonists show up, Type Zero Abraxas will appear to shoot down anything that goes beyond Lunar orbit. There are still "traditional" habs in the form of Moon bases and orbital stations, but even after the AGs are defeated, it's unlikely humanity will have much time to expand before the scenario ends.

The solution? Represent Arcologies as habs on Earth.

After researching an early project, nations will be able to use the "Build Arcology" priority. It will cost a hefty sum of IPs, likely 80-100 or so. (Compare with Build Army that needs 20-40, and Spaceflight Program or Nuclear Program that cost 50). This ensures that only the top dog nations will be able to afford them at first, and restrains them from being spammed everywhere too quickly. Later projects will of course make this more affordable for everyone.

This builds an Arcology in the most prosperous (or populous?) available region. One Arcology per region. Currently unsure whether Arcologies should be affected by Mission Control.

Hopefully I can add a button to the Regions menu, or maybe a new Arcologies menu, to the nation readout to quickly access Arcology management. It should also be possible to add new Arcology icons on the geoscape that you can click on for the same result. If all else fails, there's always the existing Habs menu.

Arcologies are currently planned to build and resupply Valkyrie-armies, produce space / special resources, and perform advanced research and manufacturing. They won't build warships - those still need to be built in space. With luck, I'll be able to simply create a third type of hab to use for this, like how stations (orbits) and bases (hab sites) are different. But I suspect not, in which case I'll have to do some ugly haxxing to get it to work. Isn't modding fun?

Initial ownership of the Arcology will go to the faction that contributed the most to its construction. Arcology ownership is independent of CPs; however, the controlling Valkyrie can be persuaded to change sides by a councillor, and this is easier or harder depending on how many CPs each faction controls in the host nation. Public opinion will also have an effect. Regime change or territorial exchanges therefore do not directly affect Arcology ownership, but can indirectly.

(The original idea was to assign Arcologies to CPs like armies are, but this would almost certainly lead to frustration when changes in CPs cause you to lose all your hard-built modules to some upstart.)

Arcologies will have significant effects on the region and nation they are built in. Their mere existence will greatly improve the efficiency of national priority investment, like the coreEco and resource flags for regions do. They provide bonuses to local defense forces, armies, and Valkyrie-armies fighting on their turf, similar to the rugged flag. A nation's inequality will be greatly influenced by the ratio of refugees to Arcology citizens. Democracy is unlikely to thrive without an effort to make it do so.

Arcologies are visible at all times on the geoscape, and make juicy but risky targets for councillor intrigue. An idea I have is that certain modules will trigger an atrocity event if an enemy councillor breaks in and exposes them. (They will be disguised as other facilities so it isn't immediately obvious.) Naturally, if the nation's democracy is high enough, a disgruntled employee might also go all Snowden on you. High risk, high reward!

(Or, of course, you can just push for a UN resolution to make said facilities legal.)

The exact mechanics for assaulting Arcologies are yet to be determined. For Antagonists it's easy. They roll an army into the region and begin to systematically exterminate the human population there; at 100% occupation, the region is totally depopulated and the Arcology is destroyed. Adjacent regions can have a chance to absorb refugees fleeing the slaughter; some projects will increase the chance to gain refugees, and also expedite their admission to an Arcology. (Mechanics for tracking and handling refugees will be a whole other story.)

(It should go without saying that the Disregard faction will absolutely refuse to admit any refugees.)

For humans it's a bit more complicated. The best way to handle this would probably be to have them also roll up with an army and occupy the region, upon which the Arcology flips to whichever faction owns the army (and / or did the most damage, if multiple armies participated). This doesn't result in a genocide... although maybe it could. I have the thought that an army could be ordered to destroy an Arcology if no enemy armies are present, which saves them the trouble of occupying it, but obviously counts as a big atrocity! Probably some % of the pop will die, and the rest will flee as refugees, as above. Disregard will of course do this at every opportunity to "thin the masses a little".

Probably what will happen is that while conventional armies *could* take an Arcology, they will resist so bitterly that it'll go a lot faster if you use (Valkyrie-)councillor actions and special forces (repurposed space marines) to weaken their defenses. Nukes and orbital bombardment will also help, although the presence of an Arcology provides some protection to friendly armies. Human Valk-armies and AG Type Zero-armies will lend their boosted combat strength to the effort. The idea is that taking a single properly militarized Arcology (or Hive, as described later) should require a significant commitment of resources on the part of the attacker. Yet another factor entrenching the power of the big dogs...

Antagonists should also have the option to (rarely) snipe Arcologies outright, if they have no defensive modules and no human army is present.

# HIVES AND BREACHES

Hives are the primary Antagonist production centres and military strongholds on Earth. They are spherical structures located inside Breaches, which are essentially dimensional pockets that outwardly resemble massive tornados spanning hundreds of kilometres.

Major Breaches formed out of the original 6 Impact sites (2 in North America, 2 in Europe, 2 in Northern Africa). Minor Breaches were built later in captured territory after the AGs emerged. As of 2070 in-quest, no Major Breach has ever been taken. Some Minor Breaches have been destroyed with significant effort by the UN.

For the scenario, the 6 Impact sites will be chosen semi-randomly for each continent. Whichever regions they land in will receive nuke levels of damage (on top of the preset "damaged" stats all nations on those continents start with). Of course, there'll be a config option to enforce the canon locations too (Denver, Cincinnati, Berlin, Madrid, Tripoli, Kankan).

Initially, regions with Major Breaches will be an economic boon to whichever factions control them, as they are the only known source of Higgs particles, a new resource that enables all sorts of techno-magical applications. This will likely be rendered as simply another passive income from nations that is accessible through controlling CPs, and can be shared by federations. It may be that some research is required before any Higgs can be extracted, so that disaster regions don't immediately bootstrap themselves into economic powerhouses. Might require completing a national priority too.

Keeping track of individual Higgs Generators, which can only be recovered from Breaches and downed Type Zeros, is under consideration. If this is so, they'd just be items that get expended to build Arcology modules and warship components for epic performance. This is kinda similar to what Mission Control does, and maybe could just replace that resource altogether, given how space is de-emphasized in this scenario. It'd have to be a permanent spend rather than building up to a cap, though, and I'd need to figure out the exact relationship between the Higgs particle and Higgs Generator resources.

(The alternative would be to just track Higgs particles only, as an income stream. Higgs acquired from Breaches could be spent to build Higgs Generator modules for Arcologies and components for warships, which would provide a non-Breach source of Higgs. I'm in favour of this because it seems simpler to me - but it's far from settled.)

(A tangential idea is to have Higgs replace the Boost resource in this scenario. AFAIK, Boost is mainly used to build habs and hab modules, which have been mostly repurposed as Arcologies in this scenario. Given the de-emphasis on space, any uses for Boost in TI could be replaced with Higgs and space resources, which Arcologies provide.)

This is all important because, some time after Higgs exploitation begins, an event fires informing you that all contact has been lost with the Breaches, and all Higgs extraction from them ceases. Shortly after, the Antagonists invade. And start killing everyone. (The exact time varies in an attempt to curtail spawn-camping.)

Antagonist armies swarm from the Breaches in overwhelming numbers. Humanity's only saving grace is that they are bunched up so close together that a swift nuclear attack will inflict massive damage to all of them. This will lead to both sides pausing to regroup before the war begins in earnest.

The exact production mechanics used by the AGs are a mystery, and will remain so until we learn more about how the aliens manage things in TI. It'd be either production-by-fiat where armies and Type Zeros are produced automatically, or maybe actually simulate full-blown habs on the AG side. I definitely lean towards the former though, seems much easier to implement :^)

Major Breaches appear to operate independently from each other; this could likely be simulated by having each one belong to a different AG faction. Each Major Breach can construct a new Minor Breach in a region it has conquered, at the cost of some resources from its owner. Minor Breaches mostly work the same as Major ones, but they are generally weaker and can't build Type Zeros. It will also be possible for the AGs to upgrade Minors into Majors at an even greater cost, such that it only happens once or twice during the scenario.

Assaulting a Breach to destroy its Hive is one of the toughest and most brutal military operations possible to undertake, even more so than an Arcology siege. First, human armies will need to move in and take out any AG armies present. The presence of the Breach and its STO defenses makes this a hard fight: a full combined-arms attack comprising standard armies, Valkyrie-armies, Valkyrie-councillors using Advise to buff the armies and carrying out missions to degrade the AG defenses, and nukes and orbital bombardment once the STO defenses are down will be the least that is required. And this is only really possible because other Breaches (generally) won't send their own forces to provide assistance, or at least will take a long time before doing so, thereby imposing a soft time limit before AG reinforcements make the assault untenable.

Once all defending AG armies are removed, a human army can open the menu that normally allows them to "strike space facilities directly or cause widespread economic damage" and select the option to begin a Hive assault. This causes the Hive to appear on the geoscape where it can be targeted. It will remain exposed unless all human armies are driven out.

Actually destroying the Hive requires a Valkyrie-councillor to perform a special Hive assault mission. This is very risky and should not be attempted without the appropriate buffs and spending a lot of the Ops and Higgs resources. Progress made by human armies to occupy the region will also provide a bonus to these rolls - at 100% occupation, it's practically an auto-win, but this will take a long time.

Multiple Hive assaults will be needed to destroy a Hive. Any faction can send its Valkyrie-councillors to participate in the effort; however, the one that lands the killing blow will be rewarded with the lion's share of the Higgs Generators looted from the Hive. This is a significant prize that will greatly bolster that faction's standing in the post-Antagonist world order. This means that you want to be the one who lands the killing blow, but because Hive assaults are so dangerous, there's an incentive to free-ride by letting other factions go first. Of course, you don't know whether *this* assault will be the one that ends it, so there remains uncertainty and someone might always get lucky.

Valkyries using Wave Force Manipulation, an advanced technique unlocked by a late-game project, will have a much easier time destroying Hives (or Arcologies). The G-Gun, which uses the same tech, will also allow whichever faction controls it to destroy any Hive with the press of a button. These developments will herald the end of the war with the Antagonists - and the beginning of a new era for humanity.
