I hear people like drawing ideological boxes and putting things in them, so here's my take on it for TI-PVC. Probably for vanilla TI as well with some tweaks.

# NATIONAL AGENDAS

The idea of this subsystem is that nations have their own pre-existing behaviours and objectives that they continue to pursue even after being infiltrated and suborned by the five human factions. Sometimes the controlling factions might find this beneficial, other times a nuisance. This is largely expected to manifest in the form of random events, and possibly some differences to the nations' regular mechanics. At the start of the scenario, when the factions' influence is weakest the agendas will be quite prominent; as the scenario progresses, they will likely evolve or disappear entirely in favour of the factions carrying out their will.

Note that these agendas exist orthogonally to the ideologies of the five factions: in theory, any agenda should be compatible with the ideologies of Domesticate, Disregard, Challenge, Self-Sustain, and Enlighten.

It is intended that the ability to change agenda will be somewhat restricted, since in reality nations have their own socio-political inertia that must be overcome. This will likely occur semi-randomly as part of another subsystem I'm calling "mandates" (see below), and possibly through certain choices in narrative events for some nations.

Many of these agendas are rather conspicuously based on the (alleged) politics and foreign policy of certain real-life nations. See if you can catch them all!

## Morganic
This represents the rapacious pursuit of economic growth and return on investment at all costs. Free enterprise unfettered by any form of regulation is capable of achieving great feats, and free competition ensures that only the brightest, the most talented, the most capable will rise to the top and claim their rightful place as market leaders.
Anything that is not immediately profitable will be discarded without a second thought. The state, if it exists, is merely a vehicle for personal enrichment and advancing private interests. The nation is prosperous, but not necessarily the people.
A country with this agenda will aim to maximize Money output, and also provides special options for using Money to make friends and influence people. The potential profits are huge, if you can handle the adverse social effects.

## Communist
This represents the long march towards a classless, egalitarian society through developing the means of production and subjugating the forces of capital under a dictatorship of the proletariat. Before Impact, this would have been the work of generations, and even with Valkyrie Cores it is by no means a simple task; not to mention questions of who, exactly, owns the Valkyrie Cores. In the meantime, there's an economy to plan, public order to maintain, ideological commitment to uphold, and imperialist aggression to deter. Running a communist state sure is hard work!
Nations with this agenda will emphasize economic development with a view to raising standards of living and reducing Inequality. Those that succeed will indeed be quite nice to live in. However, ideological stagnation heralding economic stagnation remains a constant threat, and it's easy for them to get mired down in propaganda wars.

## Liberalizing
This represents the soft, fuzzy kind of liberal democracy and capitalism, where free speech and free markets walk hand-in-hand. The road to prosperity is paved with greater and greater openness.
Elections are representative and competitive without being polarizing. Neither majorities nor minorities can tyrannize anyone. Corporations are profitable, innovative, and socially responsible. The military is morally just and purely defensive. The government is a force for good in people's lives, and yet never infringes upon anyone's freedoms.
The country is, in short, a utopia. Well, at least until it inevitably gets hijacked by some other agenda. You don't know what you have until you lose it. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.

## Academician
A somewhat exotic agenda without a direct equivalent in modern times, a country following it seeks the pursuit of scientific discovery and ultimate truth. Knowledge is power, which is why the country is led by its finest minds in accordance with empirically determined scientific theory. Science is not only the key to the universe, but also the key to good governance.
Sadly, the unenlightened masses do not always see it that way. It is unclear why they do not always behave according to the established theory, but that just means that more experimentation is needed in order to refine our hypotheses. Ultimately, the establishment of a robust education system will ensure that everyone is empowered through their acquisition of knowledge.
This country seeks to maximize Research output, and it's actually quite good at it. The downside is that it doesn't really care how it gets there, and whichever faction runs the country will frequently end up on the hook for whatever controversial experiments it's cooked up now.

## Interventionist
This country believes that it stands for all that is right and proper in the world, and that its sacred duty is to spread this moral goodness to all nations and peoples of the world. Where humanitarian assistance fails to win hearts and minds, there is always military force to change them for good.
It will frequently intervene in potential or ongoing intrastate and interstate conflicts, usually on the flimsiest of pretexts. It supports territorial integrity for allies, and self-determination for rivals. There is no regime that can't be toppled or intractable socio-cultural issue that can't be solved with enough bombing.
Whether this actually results in any improvement in the targeted nations doesn't really matter. All that matters is that we tried.

## Revolutionary
This country is undergoing or has undergone a revolution, with all the violence and disruption that entails. Even if the revolution does succeed, there's always some counter-revolutionaries who need to be purged. A revolution is a roll of the dice, and it's very likely that the outcome will be even worse than what stood before.
If things go well at home, it will likely find itself internationally isolated and probably economically devastated to boot. The solution? Make some friends, literally, using hard and soft power to export the revolution to neighbouring countries. This will definitely go very well and absolutely not backfire whatsoever.
If things go *really* well, it might even see itself on the path to chilling out and normalizing after a while (i.e. switching to another agenda). But don't hold your breath.

## Expansionist
This country aims to increase its power and influence through any means necessary; whether motivated by revanchism, paranoia, or simple opportunism. In other words, it likes map painting.
It will always be the first to act on any newly-unlocked territorial claims, and it gains special events and options for exercising them: either peacefully, or by entering war on favourable terms. And if it doesn't have a claim on its neighbours, it'll always be happy to settle for a new federation partner or client state.
However, the center cannot hold, and what is easily gained can also be easily lost. Territories acquired through less savoury means are especially prone to breaking away again if not kept continually pacified. Empires are costly endeavours, and if the controlling faction can't subsidize that cost, the ensuing collapse is sure to be sudden and quite devastating. But while it lasts, its economic and martial prowess will be second to none.

## Disruptive
This nation seeks to sow chaos in its near abroad, and even across the world, in order to keep any potential enemies off-balance and maintain its sphere of influence.
It eschews direct methods of confrontation in favour of elusive, slippery, and unprovable covert operations. It is never the aggressor, always the defender, and any attempt to disprove this will lead to endless polarization in the court of public opinion. Even if other nations figure out what they're doing and invade to do something about it, this was part of their plan all along and the blowback will be truly epic. If it is ever forced to fight, it will prefer asymmetric methods that use the opponent's strength against itself and deny it an easy victory.
This nation will have its agenda disguised as something else, requiring councillors to investigate where all these mysterious sabotages are coming from. Such sabotages occur also as random events and not because of anything this nation does, increasing the frustration factor immensely.

## Peacekeeping
This nation believes that everyone could just get along if only they tried hard enough. It will certainly put its money where its mouth is, with frequent wholehearted efforts to dispatch peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid to war-torn nations, and to mediate disputes between intrastate and interstate rivals. Of course, this sort of stance is just as likely to attract enemies as it is allies, and its reluctance to use force proactively means it can end up having to use force reactively. Perceptions of ingratitude abroad might also lead to disgruntled feelings at home: why should *they* be playing the world police?

## Stabilizing
This is a country that has been so damaged by Impact, or other calamitous events, that it can no longer present a significant foreign policy and is focused solely on internal reconstruction and recovery. It will be quite receptive to offers of foreign aid and humanitarian assistance.
Other nations could of course invade and conquer it... but then they would have to pay its bills, so why bother?

# NATIONAL MANDATES

This subsystem attempts to represent the sources of goverments' legitimacy and the processes for transferring power within a nation - a political necessity, given the sadly limited nature of human lifespans. (Until the implementation of Valkyrie Government occurs, anyway.) The idea is that governments' - and therefore nations' - behaviour will vary depending on their source of power, and that transfers of power are a delicate process which provide opportunities for factions to more easily usurp control.

The currently planned possible mandates are:
- Election: Leadership of the country is selected by a popular vote. Occurs when Democracy >= 5.
- Internal Politics: Leadership is selected by internal processes within the governing elite - palace intrigue, essentially - without seriously involving the public. Occurs when Democracy < 5.
- Occupation: This country's leadership has been imposed on it by another country. Occurs as the result of regime change.
- Revolution: This country's leadership seized power at the head of a revolution with at least some degree of popular support.
- Coup d'Etat: This country's leadership seized power in a coup d'etat.

All mandates have a timer associated with them, which begins ticking down from their commencement. When it expires, a new mandate will be instated based on Democracy score and possibly some other factors. At this time, faction ownership has the potential change depending on some combination of country stats: for Elections, it will change based on Public Opinion, and for Internal Politics it will change based on which factions have caused Unrest. If Cohesion is low and Unrest is high, there is a chance for a revolution or coup to occur.

When the mandate changes, there is a possibility that the agenda will change too. Nations will have a (hidden, possibly semi-randomized) shortlist of possible agendas they can switch to through this process, essentially representing different political parties or powerbases. There are also some special rules for changes: regime changes will change the occupied nation's agenda to the occupier's; revolutions will usually go Revolutionary; coups will have a high chance to go Morganic or switch back to the last agenda followed.
