# ARCOLOGY MECHANICS

As described in [DN#3](docs/TMM%203.md), Arcologies are intended to marry TI's vanilla space habitat mechanics with the Earth nation mechanics. This aims to represent the social and economic shifts that humanity's in-setting aggregation within such constructs implies, as well as the increasing political and economic power taken on by Valkyries and the factions they represent.

Since mechanics from both halves of the game are involved, I figured it would be good to include a refresher on how some of those work.

## NATION STATS

Described in [DD#4](https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=27816).

The dev diary already explains it pretty well, so I'll just leave it there.

## NATIONAL PRIORITY INVESTMENT

Described in [DD#5](https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=27839&sid=4037ec51f9d957808cc86e652836f04c).

Nations in TI have a certain amount of Investment Points (IPs) available, effectively their budget, which factions can direct towards filling up various priority "buckets". When the bucket is full, the priority is considered complete, and some effect takes place in the nation (usually a stats change).

Some Arcology modules will provide a bonus to national investments. This means that factions with such bonuses are able to fill up the buckets faster, triggering the relevant effects for completing the priority more often.

The scenario mostly retains the same set of priorities as TI, with a few additions and modifications.

| Priority | Effects | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Economy | +GDP per capita increases.<br>-Inequality increases.<br>-Environmental damage increases. | Unchanged from TI. |
| Welfare | +Inequality decreases.<br>+Environmental damage decreases. | Unchanged from TI. |
| Resettlement | +Moves population from "refugees" to "citizens" status. | New priority. See below for explanation of population mechanics. |
| Knowledge | +Democracy increases.<br>+Education increases.<br>-Inequality increases. | Mostly the same as in TI,  |
| Unity | +Cohesion increases.<br>-Democracy decreases.<br>+Public Opinion moves towards controlling faction(s). | Unchanged from TI. |
| Military | +If Unrest is low, Miltech score increases.<br>+If Unrest is high, Unrest decreases. | Unchanged from TI. |
| Spoils | +Grants huge lump sum of Money to controlling faction(s).<br>-Democracy decreases.<br>-Inequality increases.<br>-Environmental damage increases. | Unchanged from TI. |
| Funding | +Annual Money income increases. | --- |
| Higgs | +Higgs income from Breaches increases. | Required tech: _Higgs Particle Extraction_.<br>Replaces "Boost" priority from TI, as the Boost resource is repurposed in this scenario.<br>Note that this priority is only available during the Higgs Golden Age. It becomes unavailable upon the Antagonists' arrival. |
| STRATNET | +STRATNET capacity increases by 1. | Rebranded "Mission Control" priority from TI. Otherwise functions identically. |
| Build Army | +Nation gains one new conventional army. | Required tech: _Military Salvage_.<br>Each non-colony region in a nation can support one conventional army. |
| Build Navy | +One army in this nation gains a navy. | Required tech: _International Trade and Travel_.<br>Navies allow armies to travel overseas. |
| Nuclear Weapons | +Nation gains one nuke. | Required tech: _Strategic Deterrence_. |
| Fortifications | +One region in this nation gains a fortification. | Required tech: _Regional Defense Doctrine_.<br>Rebranded "Space Defences" priority from TI.  |
