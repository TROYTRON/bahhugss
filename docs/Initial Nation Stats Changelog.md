## Proposed Changes
- Nordic States to be de-merged into Norway, Sweden, Finland.
  - The Nordics are geographically quite significant, especially from a land war perspective. And this mod is all about land wars.
  - Current 2 CPs will be split into 6 CPs, allowing for more granular faction control.
  - Opens up more possibilities for conflicts with Russia and in the Arctic.
  - NOTE: New regions will require revising available resources.
- Northern Africa re-work:
  - Egypt and Libya to be merged into one nation consisting of 3 regions: Egyptian Upper Nile rump state (New Cairo / Aswan region), Cyrenaica peninsula and desert (Benghazi / Tobruk / Al Bayda region), Tripolitania (Tripoli region).
    - Geographically very large, but very small population, especially in former Libya (exact numbers TBD by Atashkada).
    - Politically about as relevant as Greece in this scenario, which is already merged into Southern Balkans.
- UAE to be merged into Oman, with the capital moved to Al Ain.
  - The resulting union simply named "Oman", as it is on the Gulf of Oman.
  - Al Ain is inland and features prominent oases that would be essential to post-Impact agriculture.
  - The new Oman will be a GCC member and allied with Pakistan.
