## Proposed Changes
- Nordic States to be de-merged into Norway, Sweden, Finland.
  - The Nordics are geographically quite significant, especially from a land war perspective. And this mod is all about land wars.
  - Current 2 CPs will be split into 6 CPs, allowing for more granular faction control.
  - Opens up more possibilities for conflicts with Russia and in the Arctic.
- Northern Africa re-work:
  - Egypt and Libya to be merged into one nation consisting of 3 regions: Egyptian Upper Nile rump state, Cyrenaica peninsula and desert, Tripolitania.
    - Geographically very large, but very small population, especially in former Libya (exact numbers TBD by Atashkada).
    - Politically about as relevant as Greece in this scenario, which is already merged into Southern Balkans.
