## Proposed Changes


## 01/05/2021
- Northern Africa re-work:
  - Rationale:
    - Countries with such absurdly tiny GDP and population are unlikely to be very interesting to play with.
    - However, Africa is geographically very large, which is important to account for when the Antagonists arrive. Thus it still needs a lot of regions.
    - Old colonial borders are less likely to survive the massive societal disruptions of Impact.
    - Merging groups of geographically-contiguous small states together is a well-established TI conceit.
  - \[REJECTED] Egypt and Libya to be merged into one nation consisting of 3 regions: Egyptian Upper Nile rump state (New Cairo / Aswan region), Cyrenaica peninsula and desert (Benghazi / Tobruk / Al Bayda region), Tripolitania (Tripoli region).
    - Geographically very large, but very small population, especially in former Libya (exact numbers TBD by Atashkada).
    - Politically about as relevant as Greece in this scenario, which is already merged into Southern Balkans.
  - Creation of Tuareg nation, named "Azawagh".
    - Replaces existing Niger. Contains Niamey and Tamanrasset regions.
    - New region "Tamanrasset" steals territory from northern Mali, southern Algeria, south-west Libya, and most of Niger.
    - Parts of Niger merged with Chad.
    - Remaining southern Mali merged with Upper Guinean States, ensuring that Azawagh remains landlocked.
  - Disestablishment of Mali.
    - Mali Featured quite possibly the lowest GDP of every nation. I'm not even sure if TI supports sub-billion GDPs. Only Libya, CAR, and Somalia share this problem.
    - Northwest Mali merged into Western Sahara to form a single region named "Laayoune".
    - Northeast Mali merged into Tamanrasset region.
- St Petersburg region split into Syktyvkar and Petrozavodsk (I will never remember how to spell these right).
  - Closer examination shows Komi and Karelia to be geographically separated by flooding.
  - Allows the Karelian Question to play out in this scenario, for maximum controversy!
  - Population would likely be increased to compensate. It is currently kinda low anyway. Pending Atashkada magic.
  - St Petersburg itself is very much underwater. Sorry Nevill.

## 30/04/2021
- Nordic States de-merged into Norway, Sweden, Finland.
  - The Nordics are geographically quite significant, especially from a land war perspective. And this mod is all about land wars.
  - Current 2 CPs split into 6 CPs, allowing for more granular faction control.
  - Opens up more possibilities for conflicts with Russia and in the Arctic.
  - Region resources revised.

## 29/04/2021
- Whitehorse region annexed to Arctic States. Northwest Alliance disestablished.
  - Geographical proximity; very low GDP and population; Democracy, Unrest, Education, and Cohesion are similar. Miltech and Inequality likely to be similar.
  - Alaska is not to be included because of its military dictatorship under Liquid Snake.
- UAE merged into Oman; capital moved to Al Ain.
  - The resulting union simply named "Oman", as it is on the Gulf of Oman.
  - Al Ain is inland and features prominent oases that would be essential to post-Impact agriculture.
  - Inherits foreign relations of both: GCC member and allied with Pakistan.

## 27/04/2021
- Numerous regional claims added. Asa performed magic to have BAHHSCQ Region Claims use data validation for Claimed Region and Initial Region Owner.
- Nuclear warfare GDP modifier removed from Norway in anticipation of splitting up the Nordic States. Pop modifier remains.

## 26/04/2021
- BAHHSCQ Region Claims sheet added.
- Pacific Union federation added. Members: Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea.
- Central Asian Union federation added. Members: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan.
- Cyprus split from Southern Balkans and made a separate nation. Nuke effects removed.
