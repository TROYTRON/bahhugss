The plan is indeed to keep the strategic scale of TI's ground warfare, making it a bit more interesting by extending the army mechanics.

Armies will gain XP for being in combat (1 per successful hit), which grants veterancy bonuses, and can be spent by the controlling faction to purchase new upgrade flags that give various situational bonuses. Some examples are listed in the epic country spreadsheet, like artillery and nerve gas (just like SMAC!) and drones to detect councillors.

(I plan to work on these mechanics and release them as a standalone mod, since I think they're interesting extensions regardless.)

There will also be Valkyrie-armies that you can build at Arcologies later in the scenario. These function similarly to conventional armies (maybe tied to the Arcology rather than CPs), but they can move very quickly across the map (ignoring oceans and rugged terrain) and are much more powerful in army-to-army combat. In exchange, they can't take part in occupying territory, so conventional armies are still needed.

Antagonists have their own counter to Valkyries in the form of Type Zeros. They basically obliterate anything in their path: if you don't have experienced Valks guarding Arcologies, it's gonna be a bad time.

(This is why I hope there'll be a "force 2D graphics" option in the final game, 'cause drawing new sprites is one thing, but making new models is definitely beyond my abilities right now.)

Valkyrie-councillors are used more as support units for the major ground actions. As in TI, the Advise mission lets them buff armies with their epic Command stats, and they can blow up strategic infrastructure on the geoscape and sabotage modules in enemy Arcologies (a role they share with the special forces, aka repurposed space marines from TI). I also plan to add a mission that lets them strip upgrade flags from enemy armies so they're easier to beat in combat.

They are also the only ones who can perform the important task of assaulting Antagonist Hives, which you may recall is a high-risk high-reward venture that's necessary to achieve victory. Well, it's much lower-risk once you unlock Wave Force, but that's a long way down the tech tree.

I also don't plan to get rid of space battles; achieving orbital superiority so you can bombard your enemies is still important. Especially if and when the G-Gun comes into play.
