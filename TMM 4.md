After about a fortnight's work, I crunched the numbers for almost every nation on Earth to figure out who the new top dogs after Impact are.\
I wasn't able to get the world population below 1 billion without making too many compromises, but 1.5 billion seems close enough.\
I seem to have misplaced about 300 million people somewhere, but meh, what's a few hundred million between friends?

These numbers are very much a rough estimation, but they should suffice for the purposes of creating a reasonably balanced scenario.
The methodology I used went like this:
- Use the nation's 2012 population and GDP(PPP) numbers as a base.
- Subtract the population any identifiable cities or regions lost to floods or nukes.
- Apply an arbitrary multiplier based on local circumstances, e.g. nukes, flooding, existing food insecurity, recent history of civil unrest, etc.
- Reduce GDP in proportion to the lost population.
- \# of control points = GDP^(1/4)/2

This mostly assumes that the nation keeps doing what it did previously, with no change in the standard of living, and doesn't account for lost industry or anything like that.\
However, I'm quite happy with the current results for population and CPs.\
I guess I could fudge the numbers so nations have the same number of CPs, lowering GDP-p.c. and raising population. \
I'd prefer not to change the CP formula itself unless it's absolutely necessary.\
Oh well, GDP is a spook anyway, the absolute numbers don't really matter that much here. They only matter relative to other nations.
