# FOUNDING OF THE UNITED NATIONS

The scenario begins a few years after Impact. The world remains heavily devastated and balkanized, but things have recovered enough for international travel and coordination to be feasible again. It's in this environment that the five factions, whose leaders gained political clout from taking part in the relief efforts, begin to make their play for influence.

The United Nations does not yet exist at this time, by Word of Avalanche. Its founding will likely be done through an early social science tech, the best way to represent a globally-coordinated effort. It is thus theoretically possible to delay the UN's founding, but since it blocks off further research and provides numerous benefits, I doubt many will want to.

Until then, the factions will likely busy themselves with taking control over their chosen nations, trying to rebuild them into a more respectable state, and possibly putting a brake on some of the wars taking place between and within the surviving major nations. China and India both have civil wars to resolve; Iran and Pakistan are grabbing land; South Africa and Algeria race to dominate the war-torn African continent; Turkey and Mexico are trying to make a name for themselves; even mostly-peaceful Australia and Brazil have some easy unifications to pursue with their neighbours. It'll be an eventful time for sure.

When the right conditions are met for founding the UN, the top five nations in the world (measured by population and GDP; possibly with some caveats) will be joined to a new federation, titled simply the United Nations. While more can and will join, the founding nations will receive some small privileges for doing so. This selection method means there is a good chance that the canon P5 (Australia, China, India, South Africa, Brazil) will be the ones to do so, but also allows diverging from canon somewhat.

I might include a game-start option to force the canon P5 to be the founding nations, which obviously has implications for player strategy, but likely won't affect balance too much.

Also joining the UN will be a sixth, otherwise non-existent nation: the UN Central Government (UNCG). Numerous projects will grant it claims on various regions, which can be enforced by UN member nations on its behalf. This represents direct UN administration of the world's disaster (or "disaster") areas, which all the factions will no doubt maneuver for a slice of. Any regions reclaimed from Antagonist control will also be annexed to the UNCG.

Some regional alliances will likely spring up in response to perceived UN expansionism. The main ones are the canon Mediterranean Alliance, the speculative Andean Union that appears on the map, and maybe a revived East African Federation or an Ethiopia-led alliance depending on how things go. These were all eventually subsumed by the UN in-quest, but that doesn't have to be the case here.

Russia, Europe, and America were all blown up by Impact and the subsequent nuclear exchanges, and any progress they make is likely to be wiped out when the Antagonists arrive. Nevertheless, there will be some later-game projects to resurrect them as geopolitical entities, if the factions wish for it.

# U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL

Once the UN has been reestablished, the UN Security Council can be convened every X years (depending on scenario length). At each session, a resolution will be picked from a menu and voted on. All five factions have a vote proportional to the number of CPs they control; this provides a reason to not go too crazy with all the nation-merging projects.

What will resolutions actually consist of? Good question. Truthfully, I'm not sure myself, especially since techs already represent global efforts with potentially multiple factions behind them. The idea I have in mind is major policy changes that are nonetheless reversible: encouraging or discouraging certain national priorities; redefining what counts as an atrocity; a global repopulation drive that's essentially government-sanctioned computer-aided shipping charts; an early nuclear salvage effort that grants some nukes to every UN member nation (making humanity very nervous, but very useful once the AGs arrive); and various forms of emergency powers and ethical compromises in response to the AGs.

Most notably, UN resolutions only affect UN member nations; outsiders are not affected. This provides an incentive for nations to voluntarily or "voluntarily" join the UN.

Another thing to note about resolutions is that they are "free", or maybe cost some Influence or other resources, rather than the Research needed for techs and projects.

These mechanics are shared with the standalone UN Security Council mod I plan to make for base TI. An idea is some sort of veto power for UNSC P5 nations, but this is not planned to be included right now.
